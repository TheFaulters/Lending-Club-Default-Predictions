The organization makes de-identified loan [data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) available publicly. \r\n\r\nWe began by exploring the loan data. We categorized loans into those currently in delinquency or default (risky loans) and those with no payment violations (not risky loans).   \r\nInitially, we wanted to explore some basic relationships. In the first instance, we were interested in how poorly loans had performed based on when they were issued.  \r\n\r\n![](https://thefaulters.github.io/Lending-Club-Default-Predictions/Images/Loans-delinquency-bar.png)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we were interested in whether higher risk borrowers (those with lower grades) consistently had to pay higher interest rates (and whether they indeed defaulted more often). We also wanted to make sure to account for imbalance in the dataset - since most borrowers don't default.  \r\n \r\n![](https://thefaulters.github.io/Lending-Club-Default-Predictions/Images/Risk.png) ![](https://thefaulters.github.io/Lending-Club-Default-Predictions/Images/Imbalance.png)   \r\n\r\n## Cleaning  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Random forests   \r\n  \r\n\r\n## Logistic regression     \r\n\r\n\r\n## Support vector classifier   \r\n\r\n\r\n### References\r\n   \r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\nWe would like to thank our Teaching Fellow Qing Zhao for her guidance and support on this project.
